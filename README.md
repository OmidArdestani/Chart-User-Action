# QCustomPlot User Interaction Library

## Overview

The QCustomPlot User Interaction Library is a collection of tools built on top of the QCustomPlot library to enhance user interaction with plots. It provides various features such as pointer tools, marker placement, area selection, zoom functionality, measurement ruler, and shapes drawing capabilities.

## Features

- **Pointer Tool**: Allows users to interactively explore the plot by hovering over data points and displaying their values.
  - This tool enables users to get detailed information about individual data points by simply hovering the mouse cursor over them. It enhances data exploration and analysis.

- **Marker Placement**: Enables users to place markers on the plot to highlight specific data points or regions.
  - Users can place markers at significant points on the plot to visually emphasize important data or trends. It helps in highlighting specific areas of interest.

- **Area Selection**: Allows users to select a region of interest on the plot for further analysis.
  - Users can define custom areas on the plot by dragging the mouse cursor, enabling focused analysis on specific data subsets or intervals.

- **Zoom Functionality**: Provides zoom in and out functionality to focus on specific areas of the plot.
  - This tool allows users to zoom in on specific regions of the plot for detailed examination or zoom out to view the entire plot. It enhances data visualization and analysis capabilities.

- **Measurement Ruler**: Enables users to measure distances and angles on the plot for precise analysis.
  - Users can measure distances and angles between data points or features on the plot, facilitating accurate quantitative analysis and comparison.

- **Shapes Drawing**: Allows users to draw custom shapes on the plot to annotate or highlight specific features.
  - This tool enables users to draw shapes such as rectangles, circles, or polygons directly on the plot to annotate or highlight specific data or regions of interest.
